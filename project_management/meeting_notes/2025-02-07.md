## Improvements to the use case & context diagrams

* operator added to context diagram
* use case diagram separated into 3 diagrams
  * external actors and the system
  * arm robot sub-system and the coordinator sub-system
  * turtle robot sub-system and the coordinator sub-system
  * turtle robot sub-system and the arm robot sub-system
* redefinition of some use cases to ensure the on connected to a use case is the
  one performing the action 

## Start of the requirements diagrams 

* requiremens divided by sub-system
* 'prototype' requirements to indicate what we'll need to define as restrictions
  but don't have enough information yet (ex: difference between colour).
* the dimensions the object has to move are unclear
