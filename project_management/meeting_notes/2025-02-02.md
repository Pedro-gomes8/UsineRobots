# Meeting

The project can be divided into two distinct part, one to program the mechanical
arm and one for the turtle bot. A provisional division of the team will be:
- mechanical arm: Pedro, André
- turtle robot: Gabriel, Felipe

We've evaluated that the team for the turtle robot will have to develop: 
- Navigation layer/ interface for the turtle robot
- Design a control for the navigation of the robot

And the team for the robotic arm will have to:
- Determine the position of an object with a camera
- Grab and let go of objects with the robot arm
- Determine the color of an object reliably

Some interesting documentation has been found in the following links:
- https://www.generationrobots.com/fr/403937-bras-robotique-6-axes-ned2.html
- https://archive-docs.niryo.com/dev/ros/v4.1.1/en/index.html
- https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e

Questions for future meeting with professor:
- how many cameras do we have ? From what we've understood there's one in each
  robot arm and one in each turtle robot, is that correct ?
- which version of the turtle bot do we have ?
- How should we start working with each of the robots ?

# Objectives for the week
- Set up a meeting with the proffessor (Kruszewski) responsible for the project
- Start modeling the problem in SysML
- Start the "technical specifications" document
